Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project.

Introduction: Welcome to Einstein Lab! This was what I have been wanting to do for a very long time, as my dad's website has been last updated about 10 years ago, and the code has been admittedly quite poor due to the updates. Therefore, I created a website, including new features, like a contact me page, as well as including css which was almost non-existent with the old website. There are round edges, more interactivity, more fluidity, and a more modern touch. Additionally, I modified the website so it would be possible to use on mobile devices. The idea of this website is to show prospective students and parents the benefits of Einstein lab, and see what Einstein lab can offer these students, and show how much they can grow.

Runthrough: To look through all the files, I made comments to separate the different sections of the website to make it easier. The contact.html covers the contact page of the website, the direction.html file covers the direction page of the website, the index.html covers the home page of the website, the math.html the Math A+ page, summer.html covers the Summer Programs section, and style.css covers the looks of everything. It might be a litle long, but the css is also split to the different pages. 

How to install and run project through cs50.dev:
Download the file from gradescope, and then open cs50.dev, and input the file into the repository. This is a website that doesn't require you to really do too much, so in the terminal, run cd final(or whatever you name this file to) in the terminal, and then type http-server. From there, right click on the link to open it up, and then click on index.html. That will be the website, and congratulations, you can go through the website! Every feature should work, like contacting, going through the different pages, accessing the map, and downloading the pdf file.

How to install and run project through github:
If feeling a little fancy, then download the zip file(extract), and then open up github, and create a new repository. Add all the files in the zip file into the repository. Now go to settings, and after waiting a link should pop up! It might be necessary to go to settings, and then from there go to the pages section, and then change the branch to main and with the /root folder.
